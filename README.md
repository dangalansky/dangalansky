<h3 align="center"><ins>About Me:</ins></h3>
<p align="center">I've been a million things: musician, artist, mechanic, student, teacher, programmer, chef but always a creative. Pivoting away from a focus in digital graphic design, I began my coding journey and immediately fell in love with the process. I have a background in Python and Javascript and my experience spans desktop apps, image processing, data parsing, web scraping, bots, and image recognition through deep learning and AI technologies.<br>
