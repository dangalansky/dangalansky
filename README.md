<h1 align="center">My name is Dan Galansky<br>
(he/him)
<br>I'm new here!</h1> 
<p align="center">I began my coding journey in November of 2021 and immediately fell in love with the process.<br> 
  I am currently completing <ins><em>'100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp'</em></ins> through London App Brewery.<br>
I've covered everything from data parsing to game development (both text-based and GUI)<br> as well as web scraping and automation.<br></p>
<h3 align="center"><ins>Currently focused on:</ins></h3>
<h4 align="center">
  <li>Tkinter GUI/Game Development</li><br>
  <li>Selenium Webdriver/Automation</li><br>
<!-- WebDev with Flask, Jinja and Bootstrap<br> -->
<h3 align="center">I'm here to connect with like-minds, to learn, to grow my skills.</h3>
<h4 align="center"><ins>I am not currently employed or involved in a group project. Thus, I use GitHub primarily for:</ins><br> 
  <br>
  <li>a repository of my course notes
  <li>a cloud storage to show off some of what I have built 
  <li>a working resume
</h4>
<p align="center">Please reach out, i'm hungry for knowledge and loving every minute of this journey.</p>
