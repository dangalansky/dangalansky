<h1 align="center">My name is Dan Galansky<br>
(he/him)
<br></h1> 
<p align="center">I began my coding journey in 2021 and immediately fell in love with the process.<br> 
I've completed <ins><em>'100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp'</em></ins> through London App Brewery,<br>
covering everything from data parsing to game development (both text-based and GUI)<br> as well as web scraping and automation.<br></p>
<h3 align="center"><ins>Currently focused on:</ins></h3>
<h4 align="center">
  <li>WebDev with Flask, Jinja and Bootstrap</li><br>
  <li>Project and Task Management with Notion</li><br>
<h3 align="center">I'm here to connect with like-minds, to learn, to grow my skills.</h3>
<h4 align="center"><ins>I am not currently involved in a group project. Thus, I use GitHub primarily for:</ins><br> 
  <br>
  <li>a cloud storage to share what I am building with the world 
  <li>a working resume
  <li>a repository for my notes
</h4>
<p align="center">Please reach out, i'm hungry for knowledge and loving every minute of this journey.</p>
