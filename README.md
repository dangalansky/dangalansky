<h1 align="center">My name is <span style="color: red;">Dan Galansky</span><br>
(he/him)
<br>I'm new here!</h1> 
<p align="center">I began my coding journey in November of 2021 and immediately fell in love with the process.<br> 
I am currently completing the 100 Days of Python Course through London App Brewery.<br>
I've covered everything from data parsing to game development (both text-based and GUI)<br> as well as web scraping and automation.<br></p>
<h3 align="center"><ins>Currently focused on:</ins></h3>
<p align="center">WebDev with Flask, Jinja and Bootstrap</p><br>
<p align="center">WTForms</p><br>
<p align="center">SQLite</p><br>
<h3 align="center">I'm here to connect with like-minds, to learn, to grow my skills.</h3>
<h4 align="center">I am not currently employed or involved in a group project.<br> 
  Thus, I use GitHub primarily as:
  <ul>
  <li>a repository for course notes
  <li>a cloud storage to show off some of what I have built 
  <li> a working resume
  </ul>

<p align="center">Please reach out, i'm hungry for knowledge and loving every minute of this journey.</p>
